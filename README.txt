This is my first personal project, using C++ as I learn it through my course at the University of Arizona.

I am trying to improve my skills and grow my knowledge by doing small projects such as this without outside help.

I have plans to update and clean up this code as I continue my progress in learning. 

I will admit that the code at the current state is very unclean and (mostly) kind of working. However, this project taught me a lot already in planning and thinking out solutions so that has been valuable experience already.
I am going through and cleaning up the messy code and redesigning with the lessons I have already learned since starting this project. So please excuse the mess.
