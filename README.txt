This is my first personal project, using C++ as I learn it through my course at the University of Arizona.

I am trying to improve my skills and grow my knowledge by doing small projects such as this without outside help, so I have not looked for solutions through any resource, including any AI. 
This has provided valuable learning experience as I develop my own requirements and implement everything on my own. 

I have plans to update and clean up this code as I continue my progress in learning. 

I am going through and cleaning up the messy code and redesigning with the lessons I have already learned since starting this project. So please excuse the mess.
